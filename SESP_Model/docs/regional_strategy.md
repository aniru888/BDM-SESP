| **South** (Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad) | Mar-Jun | Year-round warm | 1.30x / 0.40x |
| **West** (Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Pune) | Apr-May | Humid summer | 1.50x / 0.20x |
| **East** (Kolkata, Patna, Bhubaneswar) | Apr-Jun | Hot & humid | 1.60x / 0.15x |

## 4. Cash Flow Management by Region

### North India Challenge

The extreme seasonality (1.70x in May vs 0.05x in December) creates:
- **Strong cash inflow:** April-June
- **Weak cash inflow:** November-February

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. Collect 60% of annual fees upfront (as advance for heavy users)
2. Target moderate users who have flatter usage
3. Bundle refrigerator subscription (flat year-round)
4. Use winter months for intensive servicing (lower marginal cost)

### South India Advantage

Flatter seasonality means:
- More predictable monthly cash flow
- Lower working capital requirements
- Easier financial planning

**Optimization:**
- Can afford lower deposits
- Can offer more flexible payment options
- Lower bad debt risk (consistent bill expectations)

## 5. Service Network Considerations

### Service Density Requirements

| Tier | Target Response Time | Technicians/1000 Customers |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Metro | Same-day | 3-4 |
| Tier 2 | 24 hours | 2-3 |
| Tier 3 | 48 hours | 1-2 |

### Partner Network Strategy

**Metro Strategy:** Company-owned service centers + authorized partners
**Tier 2 Strategy:** Franchise model with intensive training
**Tier 3 Strategy:** Hub-and-spoke from nearest Tier 2 city

## 6. Pricing Impact Summary

### Margin Impact by Tier

| Tier | Fee Adjustment | Est. Margin Impact | Rationale |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Metro (T1) | Base | Rs6,454/customer | Full margin |
| Tier 2 | -5% | Rs5,800/customer | Volume compensates |
| Tier 3 | -10% | Rs5,100/customer | Market penetration |

**Portfolio Blended Margin:** Assuming 60% T1, 30% T2, 10% T3:
```
= 0.60 * 6,454 + 0.30 * 5,800 + 0.10 * 5,100
= 3,872 + 1,740 + 510
= Rs6,122/customer
```

- Delhi NCR + Bangalore
- 500 customers each
- Full pricing, premium positioning

### Phase 2: Metro Expansion (Months 4-9)
