3. Strong dealer network
4. Company presence/control
5. Media visibility for PR

**Pilot Parameters:**
- 500 customers
- 2-3 dealer locations

**CAC Breakdown:**
| Component | Budget |
|-----------|--------|
| Digital marketing | Rs600 |
| Dealer commission | Rs800 |
| Sales staff cost | Rs400 |
| Collateral/demo | Rs200 |
| **Total** | **Rs2,000** |

### CAC Reduction Strategies

1. **Bank Partnership:** Rs2,000 subsidy for credit card sign-up
   - Effectively halves net CAC
   - Banks get spending customer

2. **Referral Program:**
   - Existing customer refers: Rs500 credit
   - New customer signs: Rs500 discount
   - Expected referral rate: 12%

3. **Corporate Tie-ups:**

## 5. Pricing Communication

### What Customer Sees

**Simple Messaging:**
```
Premium AC: Rs22,500 (one-time)
Smart Care Plan: Rs599/month
Total over 5 years: Rs58,440

vs Buying: Rs65,000+
You SAVE: Rs7,000+
```

### Avoid Complexity

**DON'T say:**
- "Rs599 + GST + overage - efficiency discount"
- "Subject to usage patterns"
- "As per terms and conditions"

**DO say:**
- "Rs599/month, all-inclusive for your usage pattern"
- "Efficient use = up to Rs120 back as discount"
- "No surprise bills, no hidden charges"
